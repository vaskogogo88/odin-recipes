        <p>
            Pizza is an Italian dish consisting of a flattened, leavened bread dough baked at a high temperature with 
            toppings such as tomato sauce, cheese, and various other ingredients. It is a popular and versatile food, 
            often cooked in a wood-fired oven, and can be garnished with a wide variety of items, from pepperoni to 
            vegetables.
